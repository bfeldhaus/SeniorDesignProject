Project Summary 

As a team, we will design and develop a mobile application called UC Traffic, providing real-time traffic updates and accident reports. The application will enable users to make informed decisions about their travel routes, reducing delays, enhancing road safety, and contributing to a more efficient and enjoyable commuting experience. 

Project Scope 

UC Traffic provides real-time traffic updates, accident reports, and proper route optimization for any user in the UC area. The application uses GPS data, local traffic monitoring, and user inputs.  UC Traffics' goal is to ensure users have an efficient way of travel while reducing delays and promoting traffic safety. The goal is to have a functional prototype by the end of Spring 2026. We plan to use proper UI design to make our application user-friendly and easy to use. We plan to use Waze API with Azure licenses to gather live updates around the UC area.   

We will enable users to report accidents to make sure everyone is notified and can take proper precautions while developing an algorithm for alternative routes for all users. We plan on using user acceptance testing to ensure that our product is functional and performs in all weather and traffic conditions. We will examine trends to create functional data highlighting heavy traffic like rush hour or when the roads will have less traffic and are easier to navigate.
