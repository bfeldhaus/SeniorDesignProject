Project Summary 

As a team, we will design and develop a mobile application called UC Traffic, providing real-time traffic updates and accident reports. The application will enable users to make informed decisions about their travel routes, reducing delays, enhancing road safety, and contributing to a more efficient and enjoyable commuting experience.
